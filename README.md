# About

This is my solution to the [Wolt Backend Assignment](https://github.com/woltapp/summer2021-internship) <br />
I used Typescript and express to build the api <br />
Endpoint: /discovery (expects two query parameters lat and lon) <br />
For example: /discovery?lat=60.1709&lon=24.941

## How to run

You can quickly check the result by visiting the [deployed version](https://wolt-backend-assignment.herokuapp.com) <br />

Or to run it locally clone the repo and run:

1-npm install <br />
2-npm run dev
